  name: "The Gaudí Research Insitute"
  description: "The Gaudí Research Institute has been created to lead R & D from people who have curatorial studies and research works on Gaudí, who have led the relationship with universities and companies around the world taht have spent decades developing Gaudí's systems, who has organized numerous exhibitions and academic studies. This creation responds to the desire of international researchers that take a long career devoted to Gaudí and demanded a center where they and their disciples can attend. As well as that, after a century, it was an imperative and a debt that Gaudí was recognized and studied in his homeland as the univseral genius that he was."
