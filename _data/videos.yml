  description: "The project is a self-education on procedural animation in the open-source 3D animation tool 'Blender'. It was inspired by a short sequence on Conway in the documentary series 'Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking'. The sequence used a grid of squares to represent cells, and I was disappointed there were no adorable little beasties to elevate the simulation beyond its mathematical roots for the benefit of non-scientists."
