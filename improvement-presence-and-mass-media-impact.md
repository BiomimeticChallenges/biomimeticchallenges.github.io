### World's Expansion

After analyzing the published articles in magazines of investigation, it demonstrates a worldwide spreading of bio mimicry. In 2012, USA represented 25% from the articles published and in China was roughly 23%.
Professors and Scientifics around the world are strongly involved in researches related to biomimetic. It is included: Europe (Germany, UK, Italy, Spain and France), Japan, South Korea, India, among others. The international study related to biomimetic is at the present focused on areas related to science materials and  chemicals.  Currently, it is as well on nanotechnology, engineering, architecture, biotechnology and robotics.

### Other Expansion Dimensions

At the same time, it is expanded on the conscience and the appliance of biomimetic through: conferences and events,  advanced investigation in laboratories, government support in coordination and finance, spread in media , websites, degrees and  educative specialty.

### Wordlwide Difussion

The social media and the content and information online  related to the biomimetic are growing up. This reality is multiplying the number of people around the world that are taking part of the social media to  becoming this science into public  aim.

### Quality Certification

The emerging drive of biomimetic (biomimicry in USA) in a worldwide level has generated interest to Hanzel  Henderson, one of the most influential  evolutionary economists around the world and Janine Benyus, biologist  and who made  the biomimetic popular  during ‘90s, have created a methodology and license which identifies and recognizes the principles of biomimetic as a reversal model.  The Ethical Bio mimicry Finance™ is the brand registered that certifies an ethic positioning  towards the biomimetic future role  of progress in XXI century.

### Worldwide Spreading

Biomimetic as a new conscience and practice model, is getting more relevant and meaningful in the last years for the  world press media. Fortune, Forbes, Newsweek, Esquire, The Economist, Time, Wired, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, La Vanguardia, Nature  among others, inform about investigations, events and industrial solutions.
