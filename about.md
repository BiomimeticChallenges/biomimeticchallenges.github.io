Over 3.8 billion years, nature has undergone a constant process of trial and error with the aim of improving living organisms, processes and materials on Earth. Plants, animals and microbes are the source of inspiration for solving the actual human challenges, turning the biologic universe into a pure inspirational, creative and innovative lab.

Biomimetic is the prototype model of observation, understanding, conscience and practice that allows to understand the Nature: their systems,  patterns and  processes.
